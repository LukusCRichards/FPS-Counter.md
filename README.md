This will teach you how to create a script that tells you how your game is performing so you can tell when and where it starts performing well and badly

## Writing the Script
When you open up Unity, create a C# script and name it appropriately, such as **FrameCounter** or **FPS**. Then open the script and inside the top of public class, write in **Rect** and **GUIStyle** and name them appropriately.
